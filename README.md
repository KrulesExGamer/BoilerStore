# BoilerStore

In this project, we aim to build BoilerStore: an asset store for indie games.
A platform designed for game devs by game devs. 
The assets range from 3D models to music and much more.

Boilerstore will have a diferent aproach to asset searching. 
Our search engine will be able to provide you with the assert you are looking for
based on you inputs, and it will also be able to list assets that might help you 
finish your game based on what kind of game you are making.

## UI Desing
You can see how we designed pages and interactions 
[here](https://www.figma.com/file/0VzORJzqKJ0QuVIZ8dZElY/Web?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=3D4Uz93yfZ2p1mte-1).
We are still iterating throw diferent ideas and diferrent designs to see what works best, 
so the UI might change with time.


## Html5 + CSS3 Mockup
We created a basic html + css mockup of some pages to serve as guide and prictice.
You can find those under "/mockup/" in this repository.

As of the last update, those screens are not responsive. They were made for desktop browsers.

The mockup is structured like this:

    mockup
    | index.html
    | other pages (.html)
    | css (css style sheets)
    | dep (dependencies and fons)
    | img (images)

## Design principles
Since we aim to promote artistic exppresion, our UI design was made around the idea of "creativity".
We use the following elements to try to express such mood:
- smoth gradients
- round and sharp corners combined
- slight angles
- non conformant diferently sized boxes
- etc


## Requirements
- User must be able to search assets based on name, category, 
price range etc.
- User must be able to search suggested assets or assets bundles based on 
game genre, target public, etc.
- User must be abble to create assets bundles.
- User must be abble to buy assets and asserts bundles.


## Comments About the Code
There is no meaningfull comment to add here for now, since we are in the design fase.

## Test Plan
To be created.

## Test Results
To be seen. At this point, we have few knolege about testing frameworks. 
So, when it comes to thsting, we can only safely assume we are gonna pass it :p

## Build Procedures
The mockup is a simple html + css page: dowload it, doble click it and run it with a browser ans you're done.

## Problems
We had a lot of issues to centralize a div.
