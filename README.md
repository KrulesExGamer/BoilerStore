# BoilerStore

In this project, we aim to build BoilerStore: an asset store for indie games.
A platform designed for game devs by game devs. 
The assets range from 3D models to music and much more.

Boilerstore will have a diferent aproach to asset searching. 
Our search engine will be able to provide you with the assert you are looking for
based on you inputs, and it will also be able to list assets that might help you 
finish your game based on what kind of game you are making.

## UI Desing
You can see how we designed pages and interactions 
[here](https://www.figma.com/file/0VzORJzqKJ0QuVIZ8dZElY/Web?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=3D4Uz93yfZ2p1mte-1).
We are still iterating throw diferent ideas and diferrent designs to see what works best, 
so the UI might change with time.


## Html5 + CSS3 Mockup
We created a basic html + css mockup of some pages to serve as guide and prictice.
You can find those under "/mockup/" in this repository.
